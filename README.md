# Daisy Chain Network Visualization

An interactive web-based simulation of a Daisy Chain network topology with a comic book-inspired UI. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of network communication, token passing protocols, and network visualization in an engaging and educational way.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Network Visualization**
  - Dynamic node addition and removal
  - Real-time network status monitoring
  - Visual representation of data packet transmission
  - Comic book-style UI with engaging animations

- **Network Management**
  - Add/remove network nodes dynamically
  - Toggle node power states
  - Simulate wire failures
  - Recover removed nodes
  - Control network bandwidth

- **Token Passing Protocol**
  - Visual token movement between nodes
  - Direction control (forward/backward)
  - Adjustable token interval
  - Token-based message transmission

- **Message Transmission**
  - Select source and destination nodes
  - Queue-based message handling
  - Real-time transmission visualization
  - Success/failure tracking

- **Network Statistics**
  - Active nodes count
  - Broken connections tracking
  - Message success rate
  - Packets sent counter

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom animations and comic book styling)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5
- Font Awesome Icons
- Google Fonts

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daisy-chain-network.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

3. Use the control panel to:
   - Add/remove nodes
   - Toggle node power states
   - Send messages between nodes
   - Adjust network parameters
   - Monitor network statistics

## 📚 Educational Value

This project serves as an excellent learning tool for:
- Understanding Daisy Chain network topology
- Learning about token passing protocols
- Visualizing network communication
- Understanding network failures and recovery
- Studying network performance metrics

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Adding Nodes**
   - Click the "Add Node" button to add new nodes to the network
   - Nodes will be automatically connected in a daisy chain pattern

2. **Node Management**
   - Use the power toggle button on each node to turn it on/off
   - Click on connections to simulate wire failures
   - Use the "Recover All" button to restore removed nodes

3. **Message Transmission**
   - Select source and destination nodes from the dropdown menus
   - Adjust network bandwidth using the speed slider
   - Click "Send Data Packet" to initiate transmission
   - Monitor the message queue and network logs for results

4. **Network Monitoring**
   - View real-time network statistics
   - Monitor message history
   - Track active nodes and broken connections
   - Observe token movement and message transmission
